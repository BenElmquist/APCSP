	<p>Junior year was pretty hard for me but had its bright spots as well. I took a lot of hard classes as well as AP tests and SATs, and it was all very difficult, but now, all that hard work is paying off, as its almost over. Ive finished all my standardized testing for the year and some of my finals. Only about 3 classes left to go!</p>
